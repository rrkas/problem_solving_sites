Problem
You are playing a game called Mario and your task is to save the princess.
The game is represented as a 2D grid of dimensions h x n, where h is the height of the grid and n is the length of the grid (grid is placed vertically). The grid consists of two characters ‘ . ’ and ‘ * ’.
Where ' . ' represents a free space and ' * ' represents a block. You cannot pass through a position having a block.
In free space you are either falling down or standing. You can only stand on top of a block (that is your position is in free space and just below a block is present). If just below a block is not present you keep falling down until just below a block is encountered. If a block never comes and you exit the grid, you die. Also if you exit the grid from anywhere (up, down, left or right) you die.
While standing you can move left or right by 1 step (i.e from (i, j) to (i, j+1) or (i, j-1)).
While standing you can also make jumps of height 1 and 2 and then move left or right by 1 step (i.e move up by 1 step and then move left or right by 1 step or move up by 2 steps and then move left or right by 1 step). Note: For all these moves/jumps you cannot pass through a block.
E.g. if just above you a block is present then you cannot make jumps. If 2 steps above you a block is present then you can make jumps of height 1 but not 2.
You are initially at cell (h-1,1) and you have to reach cell (h-1,n) to save the princess.
If you can reach cell (h-1,n) print “Princess Saved” else print “Princess Died”.
Note : Cells (h-1,1) and (h-1,n) will always be free space and cells (h,1) and (h,n) will always be block.
