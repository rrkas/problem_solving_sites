Problem
Given an array a 1 , a 2 , …... a n of length n and q queries. Each query consists of two types of operation.
First type of query consists of 2 integers -- x and y. You need to replace the element present at x th index of the array with value y. In Second type of query take prefix-sum of updated array and print left most index and right most index having positive number as its value in array obtained by prefix-sum.
Note :
All updates are considered for upcoming queries and it is guaranteed that there is at least one query of 2 nd type. And 0 is neither positive neither negative. If there is no index with positive value then output only -1.



Input Format
First line contains n and q , where n denotes the length of array and q denotes the number of queries.
Second line contains n space separated elements of the array.
Next q lines contains queries as follows :
Each q lines contains 1 st integer as t which denotes the type of query (t = 1 or t = 2). If query is of type 1 (t = 1) then it follows two integers ind and val. Where ind represents the index of the array whose value is to be replaced by the val.



Output Format
For each 2 nd type of query output the left most and right most index having positive value after taking the prefix-sum of the array.
If there is no index with positive value then output only -1.



Constraints
1 <= n, q <= 10 6 . 1 <= x <= n. −10 9 ≤y,arr[i]≤10 9 .



Sample 1:
Input Output 7 5 1 2 3 -7 1 -2 -5 2 1 6 5 2 1 1 -30 2 1 3 1 6 -1



Explanation:
For 1 st query
1 st query is of type 2. So prefix-sum of array is : [1, 3, 6, -1, 0, -2, -7]. So here the left most index with positive value is 1. And the right most index with positive value is 3.
For 2 nd query
2 nd query is of type 1. So according to query we need to replace the element present at 6 th index with value 5.
So array becomes : [1, 2, 3, -7, 1, 5, -5].
For 3 rd query
3 rd query is of type 2. So prefix-sum of array is : [1, 3, 6, -1, 0, 5, 0]. So here the left most index with positive value is 1. And the right most index with positive value is 6.
For 5 th query there is no index with positive value. So we return -1.



Sample 2:
Input Output 6 5 -1 -3 5 -5 2 -3 2 1 5 5 2 1 5 1 2 3 3 3 5 3 3
