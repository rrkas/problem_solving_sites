Problem
Today Jamshed learned about the plus and minus signs in Maths. So in curiosity of exploring the operations on plus and minus signs he created a question and became sad when he was unable to solve it. You, being best friends with Jamshed, want to make him happy. Jamshed becomes happy only if the question is solved. So you decide to solve the question.
You are given an array of length n and two integers l and r (l<=r). You have to choose a subsequence of length k (0 <= k <= n) such that
∑ i=0 i<k [ (−1) i x arr[i] ] , should be maximum.
Jamshed had added another constraint to make the problem more difficult : If we choose i th element then the next chosen element should be in range of (i+l) th to (i+r) th (inclusive).
You need to output the maximum value of the chosen subsequence of length k (0 <= k <= n) and print the indexes of the chosen subsequence.
If multiple answers exist then output any possible answer.
Note : It is possible that you need not to select any element in the subsequence i.e. k=0. For empty subsequence the value is 0.



Input Format
First line contains three integers n , l , r. Where n represents the length of the array and l , r are integers mentioned in the function given in question. Second line contains n space separated integers representing the array elements.



Output Format
Output consist of three lines.
First line contains the maximum value obtained from chosen subsequence. Second line contains the total number of chosen elements (x). Third line contains x space separated integers denoting the indexes of chosen subsequence.
If multiple sequences possible then print any.



Constraints
1 <= n <= 10 5 1 <= l <= r <= n −10 9 ≤v[i]≤10 9



Sample 1:
Input Output 10 3 4 -12 -4 6 -2 4 -3 7 8 9 -2 18 3 3 6 9



Explanation:
Here the maximum value is 18.
So we choose 3 indices 3 6 and 9. So value at index 3 is 6 and at index 6 is -3 and at index 9 is 9.
So sum = (−1) 0 * 6 + (−1) 1 * (-3) + (−1) 2 * 9 => 6 + 3 + 9 => 18.
Here the index 3 6 9 satisfies the constraints of l and r as well.



Sample 2:
Input Output 5 5 5 -5 -2 4 -3 -4 4 1 3
